A school gives us the opportunity to come together as a collective with the dual objective of working on the material and working on ourselves. Through the group we give ourselves a chance to change, transform and most notably, provide a space to awaken and become conscious. A movement practice will provide the platform and broad range of material to contend with. In taking part in a movement school like this I’ll aim to teach material that will help you foster a lifelong movement practice that is independent in its own way and truly unique to you as an individual. We come together as a group to share that unique perspective and elevate our own understanding of movement as part of a community. The school will follow a curriculum based approach in exposing students to what I feel are fundamental practices (listed below) that relate to the field of movement. The teachings will be delivered in an organised, modular and process-based approach in order to present these various systems as a coherent body of knowledge.

Also the time has changed back to Sunday, still going ahead for 7 pm. Tonight's meeting is on the classic philosophical self-inquiry question of to what degree are you a robot? And by the implication then to what degree can you become free of being a robot? Here are some generic questions inspired by the meeting's topic: Are You a Robot? Are you motivated by desires? Are you manipulated by urges? Is the world you live in merely a paradigm? Is reality for you only thoughts, concepts and feelings? Is fear, love, likes and dislikes only reactions as guides to survival? Are all interactions with others a means to obtaining what you need? Are all actions learned or innate habit patterns? Is “That which you really are” substituted by identities? Do beliefs and understanding substitute for knowing? Are free will and freedom of choice excuses for any of these manipulations? What is the origin of your next thought? How would an awake and conscious individual react to these questions? How would someone mechanically-driven and internally manipulated react to these questions? People don't like to hear that they might be mechanical. Being a robot suggests that we are programmed.",

These evenings are not classes or tutorials, rather a very friendly informal evening. We have a wide range of people who come. Some are absolute beginners who do not even work or study electronics, but are interested to know more. Others have something that they are already working on. We almost always have some first time visitors and we always give them a tour of the space. Come in with your Pi, Arduino, or whatever you have. Bring your laptop. Maybe you want to make something, solder, breadboard or use our electronic gear. Maybe you have some vague ideas and just want to get started. Or maybe you’re just curious……if so, it’s fine to come along and just see what others are doing. If you would like to get even more involved and have the full use of our space, we would be delighted to have you as a full member. Membership brings many benefits. We are located behind Mr Price and the Bright Lights store on Kylemore Road. We have lots of free parking available.",
